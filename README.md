### Spring cloud features and Patterns

**Cloud Patters** - Cloud seems an ovious choice for projects these days. However what really important is to really understand the needs of a particular project and then implement the cloud correctly.

Things are chainging at a rapid rate and thus we should keep our system really agile and adaptable to make use of the latest and even future technologies.

>### *Whatâ€™s the point of these intimidating Patters?*
These patterns though sometimes may feel over the top but really helps an orginasization to grow and still maintain its agility.

### *Why should I care?*
Because this is the future. These patters will one day become the de facto standard for an enterprise of any size or type. These patters have proved successful for major technology players and so we can't just ignore them.
